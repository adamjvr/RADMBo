RADMBo
======
Prototype for a next generation CNC control hardware intended to run TinyG and implement the Kinen Platform. This prototype will be designed as a reverse shield for the Arduino DUE, utilizing the TinG2 port by Synthetos. A fully integrated version featuring a new yet to be choosed ARM Cortex M4 will be the next iteration. The name RADMBo comes fromtoe RAMBo project by Ultimachine as it borrow's heavily from the RAMBo electrical design.

NO Longer being developped, this design concept and project are now depreciated and replaced with the ZBoard lineup.
